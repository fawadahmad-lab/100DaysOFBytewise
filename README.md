# 100DaysOFBytewise
100 Days of Machine learning - Deep Learning Fellowship | Bytewise Limited

Welcome to the "100DaysOfBytewise" repository! Here, you'll find a collection of daily tasks related to machine learning and deep learning that I've undertaken as part of my personal journey to improve my skills in these areas.

Purpose
The purpose of this repository is to document my progress and learning throughout the 100 days, as well as to serve as a resource for others who are interested in machine learning and deep learning.

Structure
The repository is organized into folders for each day, with each folder containing the tasks completed on that particular day. Within each daily folder, you'll find code files, notebooks, datasets, and any other relevant materials related to the tasks.

Getting Started
To explore the tasks and code, simply navigate to the folder corresponding to the day you're interested in. You can then view the files directly on GitHub or clone the repository to your local machine to run the code and experiment with it yourself.

Contents
The tasks covered in this repository include a wide range of topics in machine learning and deep learning, such as:

Data preprocessing
Model training and evaluation
Neural network architectures
Natural language processing
Computer vision
Reinforcement learning
And much more!
Contributions
While this repository primarily serves as a personal log of my own progress, contributions in the form of suggestions, feedback, and improvements are always welcome! If you notice any errors in the code or have ideas for how to enhance the tasks, feel free to open an issue or submit a pull request.

Connect with Me
If you have any questions, comments, or just want to connect, you can reach out to me via email or social media. I'm always interested in discussing machine learning and deep learning topics with fellow enthusiasts!

Happy coding, and here's to 100 days of byte-sized learning!
